# AI Assistant Interactions Log

This document records all interactions with AI assistants during the development of the MCP Inspector Lite plugin.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a minimal IntelliJ/PyCharm plugin in Kotlin that connects to an MCP server, lists available tools, and lets users invoke tools with parameters.

**AI Assistant Used**: Claude Sonnet 4 (via Cursor)

## Development Process

### 1. Initial Planning and Research

**AI Assistant Role**: 
- Helped research current IntelliJ plugin development best practices
- Provided guidance on Compose Multiplatform integration
- Researched MCP (Model Context Protocol) specifications
- Suggested project structure and architecture

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Use Kotlin with Compose Multiplatform for modern UI
- Implement JSON-RPC 2.0 for MCP communication
- Create a three-pane layout as specified
- Build a simple Python test server for development

### 2. Project Structure Setup

**AI Assistant Contributions**:
- Generated `build.gradle.kts` with appropriate dependencies
- Created `plugin.xml` configuration
- Set up proper directory structure for IntelliJ plugin
- Configured Gradle wrapper and build settings

**Challenges Addressed**:
- Resolved dependency conflicts with IntelliJ Platform
- Fixed Kotlin serialization plugin configuration
- Addressed experimental API warnings in Compose

### 3. MCP Protocol Implementation

**AI Assistant Role**:
- Designed data models for MCP protocol (`McpModels.kt`)
- Implemented HTTP client for JSON-RPC communication (`McpClient.kt`)
- Created proper error handling and state management
- Implemented coroutines for async operations

**Technical Decisions**:
- Used Ktor HTTP client for network communication
- Implemented StateFlow for reactive UI updates
- Created proper JSON-RPC request/response handling
- Added connection state management

### 4. User Interface Development

**AI Assistant Contributions**:
- Designed three-pane Compose UI layout
- Implemented connection management pane
- Created tools listing with selection
- Built parameter input and results display
- Added proper error handling and loading states

**UI Features Implemented**:
- Connection status indicators
- Tool selection and details view
- JSON parameter input with validation
- Results display with proper formatting
- Responsive layout with proper spacing

### 5. Test Server Development

**AI Assistant Role**:
- Created Python-based MCP test server
- Implemented example tools (echo, add_numbers, get_time, reverse_string)
- Added proper JSON-RPC error handling
- Created test client for server validation

**Server Features**:
- HTTP server with CORS support
- Four example tools with different parameter types
- Proper MCP protocol compliance
- Error handling and logging

### 6. Build System and Documentation

**AI Assistant Contributions**:
- Resolved Gradle build issues
- Fixed Java instrumentation problems
- Created comprehensive README documentation
- Added startup scripts and test utilities

**Build Challenges Resolved**:
- Disabled instrumentation to fix Java path issues
- Removed conflicting dependencies
- Added proper Kotlin compiler options
- Successfully built plugin distribution

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices

1. **Compose Multiplatform**: Chosen for modern, declarative UI development
2. **Ktor Client**: Selected for robust HTTP/JSON-RPC communication
3. **StateFlow**: Used for reactive state management
4. **Coroutines**: Implemented for non-blocking async operations

### MCP Protocol Implementation

1. **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Full compliance with standard
2. **Tool Discovery**: Implemented `tools/list` method
3. **Tool Invocation**: Implemented `tools/call` method
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error codes and messages

### Plugin Integration

1. **Tool Window**: Integrated with IntelliJ Platform
2. **Compose Integration**: Used ComposePanel for embedding
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and disposal

## AI Assistant Workflow

### Information Gathering
- AI assistant performed web searches for current best practices
- Researched MCP protocol specifications
- Found relevant documentation and examples

### Code Generation
- Generated complete, working code files
- Provided proper error handling and edge cases
- Included comprehensive comments and documentation

### Problem Solving
- Diagnosed and fixed build configuration issues
- Resolved dependency conflicts
- Addressed API compatibility problems

### Documentation
- Created detailed README with setup instructions
- Generated comprehensive code comments
- Provided troubleshooting guidance

## Lessons Learned

### Effective AI Collaboration

1. **Clear Requirements**: Providing specific, detailed requirements led to better results
2. **Iterative Development**: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps worked well
3. **Error Resolution**: AI assistant was effective at diagnosing and fixing build issues
